# paralelProgramming
Simple program for learning how to use openMP and vectorization to speed up a C++ code.
In this case we use parallel collection of 16 elements from two arrays in third along with threading and parallelization
with omp simd. For this case we multiply 2 matrix with 2048 elements
horizontal and vertical and without the mods the result for my laptop is 50 seconds and after the mods is 7 seconds.
