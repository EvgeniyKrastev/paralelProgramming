# paralelProgramming
Description: Parallelization of linear matrix C++ code using OpenMP and Vectorization. We use parallel collection of 16 elements from two arrays in the third array, along with threading and parallelization with OMP SIMD. We multiply 2 matrices with 2048 elements horizontally and vertically. Before mods on my laptop results are 1 minute and after, it is 6 seconds. To run the code, you need to execute it on Linux and install GCC and G++ from the command line. Then, follow the steps mentioned in the matrix.cpp file.

Technologies: C++, OpenMP Parallelization, OpenMP threads, Vectorization
